What is material design ?
Google's Material Design is a design system created by Google in 2014 to provide a consistent and unified visual language for all of its products and services. It is a design language that combines classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. Material Design was introduced to unify the user experience across all Google products, including Android, Chrome OS, and the web.

The main concept behind Material Design is to create a visual language that mimics the physical world, with realistic shadows, lighting, and textures. This approach is called "material" because it uses physical metaphor to create a visual language that is intuitive and easy to use.

Some of the key features of Material Design include:
-	Material: The visual style of Material Design is based on paper and ink, with a focus on depth, shadows, and lighting. This creates a sense of hierarchy and helps users understand how different elements relate to each other.
-	Motion: Material Design emphasizes the importance of motion in creating a natural and intuitive user experience. Animations and transitions are used to provide feedback and communicate the relationships between different elements.
-	Grids and Layouts: Material Design uses a consistent grid system to create a sense of order and structure. This helps users navigate and understand the interface.
-	Typography: Material Design emphasizes typography as a way to create hierarchy and express content. It uses a specific set of typefaces and styles to create a cohesive and consistent visual language.
-	Colour: Material Design uses bold and vibrant colours to create a sense of energy and playfulness. Colour is used to communicate different moods and emotions, and to help users navigate the interface.

User personalized theming and dark mode

Theming and dark mode are essential design features that can significantly impact the user experience of an application or website. Here are some reasons why theming and dark mode are important:
-	Personalization: Theming allows users to personalize their experience of an application or website. Users can choose a theme that reflects their preferences, making the interface more appealing and engaging.
-	Accessibility: Dark mode can make an application or website more accessible to users with visual impairments or light sensitivity. The high contrast of dark mode can reduce eye strain and improve readability for some users.
-	Energy Efficiency: Dark mode can save battery life and reduce eye fatigue for users who spend a lot of time on their devices. Bright screens can be hard on the eyes and consume more battery power than dark screens
-	Aesthetic Appeal: Dark mode is often seen as sleek, modern, and stylish. It can create a unique aesthetic that sets an application or website apart from competitors.
Theming and dark mode are essential design features that can improve the user experience and make an application or website more appealing and accessible. They can also be used to support branding efforts and create a unique visual identity for an application or website.
